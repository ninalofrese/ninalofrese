### Hi there üëã, welcome to my github page!

I'm a Android Developer working mostly with Kotlin at TruckPad.

- I ‚ù§Ô∏è to build Android apps and learning new stuff.
- üå± I'm currently learning Android unit tests and TDD.
- I was a journalist in my previous life, but I also built websites in WordPress for small companies.
- ‚òï I started Android studies with Java, but there are rumors that it all started with ASP 12 years ago, but I have no memories of it.

Check some of my personal projects below!
